The ssl-gan directory lists the code for implementing semi-supervised generative adversarial networks for image classification that we used for view and LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy) classification.

The pipeline directory contains the code for models used in solely supervised techniques (segmentation then classification) for the same classification tasks as above.
